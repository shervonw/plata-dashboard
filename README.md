# Plata Dashboard

##Background

This web dashboard was created using AngularJS + Firebase. Basic CRUD actions as the foundation, it was made as part my final year capstone project to manage clients of a Landscaping company.

The Landscaping company wanted a way to know if the clients were watering the plant which she landscaped on the client's property adequately. If these plant are not watered as instructed the can result in a void warranty and Alica's landscaping company losses money.

I created both hardware and all software solutions.

This app operates in real-time allowing the admin to view client. The hardware device collected moisture levels reading and sends it to Firebase. From there, the data can be view in real time per client.
